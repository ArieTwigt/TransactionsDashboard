# Transactions Dashboard
This dashboard is an experiment with shiny and R. The dashboard takes a csv-file as input with transaction data of customers at a (web)shop. Based on this file the dashboard displays valuable information about revenue, customers, customer segments and other valuable marketing information. The requirements of the csv-input file are: four columns where: column 1 contains the customerID, column 2 contains the date of transaction, column 3 contains the quantity of products sold and column 4 contains the transaction value.
